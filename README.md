# TellCo Due Diligence Analysis

This project provides a detailed analysis of TellCo, a mobile service provider in the Republic of Pefkakia, with the goal of evaluating its potential for growth and profitability. The analysis is based on a dataset containing information about customers and their activities on the network.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to assess whether TellCo is a worthwhile investment by examining the data generated by their network systems. Insights will be derived to identify growth opportunities, and a recommendation will be made on whether to buy or sell the company. The analysis will be presented via an easy-to-use web-based dashboard and a written report.

## Key Analysis Areas

1. **Customer Segmentation and Behavior**  
   Identifying customer segments based on usage patterns, including data consumption, call frequencies, and service preferences. This will allow us to highlight key demographics for targeted service offerings.

2. **Revenue and Profitability Analysis**  
   Examining the profitability of different services, pricing models, and geographical areas. We will focus on identifying high-revenue segments or underserved markets that present opportunities for growth.

3. **Network Utilization**  
   Analyzing network traffic and congestion to identify potential inefficiencies in the service delivery model. Optimizing network usage could improve customer satisfaction and reduce operational costs.

4. **Churn Prediction**  
   Understanding which customer segments are most likely to churn and why. This analysis will help recommend strategies for customer retention and reducing churn.

5. **Opportunities for New Product/Service Offerings**  
   By analyzing customer behavior and preferences, we will identify potential new products or services that could increase revenue and customer satisfaction.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Analysis**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI, or Dash (for interactive web-based dashboard)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn for churn prediction and clustering
- **Database**: SQL (for data extraction and analysis)
- **Reporting**: Jupyter Notebooks, Word/PDF for detailed written report

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Clean and preprocess the raw data to ensure that it is ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Conduct initial analysis to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns in the data. Visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots will be used to help interpret the findings.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Using clustering algorithms like k-means, we will group customers based on usage patterns and demographics. These clusters will provide insights into which customer groups are most profitable.

4. **Profitability Analysis**  
   By analyzing the data at the product/service level, we will assess the profitability of different offerings and identify areas for potential growth.

5. **Churn Prediction Model**  
   Build a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical data. This will allow us to identify high-risk customers and recommend strategies to retain them.

6. **Dashboard & Reporting**  
   Develop a user-friendly, interactive web-based dashboard that allows the investor to explore the analysis and visualize key insights. The written report will summarize the findings and provide actionable recommendations.

## Deliverables

1. **Web-Based Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard for exploring the insights and trends from the data analysis.
2. **Written Report**: A comprehensive report detailing the findings, opportunities for growth, and a recommendation on whether TellCo is worth buying or selling.

## Recommendation Criteria

The final recommendation to the investor will be based on:

- The scalability of TellCo's current services and their potential for growth.
- The profitability of existing customer segments and products.
- Opportunities to optimize the network and reduce churn.
- Potential for expansion into new markets or products.

## Conclusion

By providing a detailed analysis of TellCo’s financials, customer data, and operational efficiency, this project will help inform the investor’s decision on whether to proceed with the acquisition or seek other investment opportunities.
