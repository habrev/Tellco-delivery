# Telecom User Analytics Project

This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a telecom company to uncover insights related to user engagement and handset usage. The goal is to understand customer behaviors, identify trends, and provide actionable recommendations for marketing and technical teams to improve the overall user experience and business performance.

## Tasks Overview

### Task 1: User Overview Analysis

Understanding the types of devices used by customers is crucial for providing better services, creating tailored marketing strategies, and optimizing product offerings. In this task, we will explore the data to:

1. **Identify the Top 10 Handsets Used by Customers**  
   Analyze handset usage to find the top 10 most popular devices among customers.

2. **Identify the Top 3 Handset Manufacturers**  
   Investigate the handset manufacturers to determine which ones dominate the market.

3. **Identify the Top 5 Handsets per Top 3 Handset Manufacturer**  
   For the top 3 manufacturers, identify the 5 most popular handsets from each.

4. **Interpretation and Recommendations**  
   Based on the findings, provide recommendations to the marketing team for targeted campaigns, product optimization, or market expansion.

### Task 2: User Engagement Analysis

In the telecom industry, understanding user engagement is crucial for improving customer retention and optimizing network resources. In this task, we will focus on the following key metrics:

1. **Sessions Frequency**  
   Analyze the frequency of user sessions to understand how often users engage with the telecom services.

2. **Duration of the Session**  
   Measure the length of each session to determine how engaged users are during their interactions with the services.

3. **User Engagement Segmentation**  
   Track user engagement across different applications and customer clusters to help technical teams optimize network resources.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Analysis**: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter Notebooks
- **Reporting**: Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks for written analysis

## Steps for Analysis

### Task 1: User Overview Analysis

1. **Load and Preprocess the Data**  
   Clean the data and identify any missing values or outliers. Handle missing data appropriately and prepare the dataset for analysis.

2. **Top 10 Handsets Used by Customers**  
   Use frequency analysis to determine which handsets are most commonly used.

3. **Top 3 Handset Manufacturers**  
   Group the handsets by manufacturer and identify the top 3 manufacturers by total number of users.

4. **Top 5 Handsets per Top 3 Handset Manufacturers**  
   For each of the top 3 manufacturers, list the top 5 most used handsets.

5. **Interpretation and Recommendations**  
   Based on the analysis, make suggestions for targeted marketing strategies, such as offering discounts or promotions on the most popular handsets or manufacturers.

### Task 2: User Engagement Analysis

1. **Sessions Frequency Analysis**  
   Track the number of sessions each user engages in over a specified period. This will help determine how frequently customers interact with the telecom services.

2. **Session Duration Analysis**  
   Analyze the length of user sessions to determine engagement levels. Longer sessions may indicate more active users.

3. **Cluster Users Based on Engagement**  
   Using the session frequency and duration metrics, segment users into different engagement clusters. This will help determine which user groups are highly engaged and which require attention.

4. **Engagement Recommendations**  
   Based on the engagement patterns, suggest optimizations for improving user retention and engagement. This may include adjusting network resources or focusing on high-engagement user segments.

## Deliverables

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Insights on the handset usage and engagement metrics, including the top handsets, manufacturers, and user engagement patterns.
2. **Visualization**: Graphical representations of handset usage, frequency of sessions, session durations, and engagement metrics.
3. **Written Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the findings and offering actionable recommendations for the marketing and technical teams.
4. **Recommendations for Marketing and Technical Teams**: Based on Task 1 and Task 2, provide targeted strategies to increase user engagement and optimize the network.

## Conclusion

By understanding the most commonly used handsets, identifying top handset manufacturers, and analyzing user engagement, this project will provide valuable insights into how the telecom company can better serve its customers, allocate network resources efficiently, and create marketing campaigns tailored to high-value user segments.
